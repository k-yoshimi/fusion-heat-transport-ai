MULTI-AGENT SOLVER SELECTION ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

## 1. Statistical Summary (from StatisticsAgent)
   implicit_fdm: 430 samples (99.5%)
   spectral_cosine: 2 samples (0.5%)
   Total samples: 432
   Features: 12

## 2. Feature Analysis (from FeatureAgent)
   Training accuracy: 99.5%
   Top 5 features by importance:
      1. dt: 0.29
      2. nr: 0.14
      3. t_end: 0.14
      4. max_abs_gradient: 0.14
      5. max_chi: 0.14

## 3. Decision Patterns (from PatternAgent)
   Extracted 8 decision rules

## 4. Synthesis and Recommendations
   Based on multi-agent analysis:
   - Implicit FDM dominates (>95% win rate)
   - Consider using FDM as default without ML selection
   - Key decision factor: dt
   - Spectral solver only wins in edge cases
   - Recommend improving spectral solver stability
