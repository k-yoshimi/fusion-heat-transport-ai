## Key Findings

### Hypothesis Confirmed
  - Alpha > 0.5 always leads to FDM selection

## Confirmed Hypotheses

  [Confidence: 100%] Alpha > 0.5 always leads to FDM selection
    Evidence: FDM wins 99.9% for alpha > 0.5
  [Confidence: 95%] Spectral solver only wins when problem_stiffness < 1.90
    Evidence: Max stiffness for spectral wins: 1.9022
  [Confidence: 80%] Grid parameters (nr, dt, t_end) are more important than physics parameters
    Evidence: Grid importance: 10, Physics importance: 3

## Caveats and Limitations

  [minor] Feature 't_end' has only 3 unique values - importance may be inflated

## Recommendations

  1. Use implicit_fdm as the default solver
  2. Consider removing ML selector for this IC (T0 = 1 - r^2)
  3. Improve spectral solver stability for threshold-based chi
  4. Add more diverse initial conditions to training data
