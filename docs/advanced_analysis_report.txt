## Key Findings

### Distribution
  - implicit_fdm wins 99.5% of cases
### Hypothesis Confirmed
  - Alpha > 0.0 always leads to FDM selection

## Confirmed Hypotheses

  [Confidence: 100%] Alpha > 0.0 always leads to FDM selection
    Evidence: FDM wins 99.7% for alpha > 0.0
  [Confidence: 95%] Spectral solver only wins when problem_stiffness < 0.27
    Evidence: Max stiffness for spectral wins: 0.2708

## Caveats and Limitations

  [moderate] Near 100% dominance might indicate limited parameter diversity in training data
  [minor] Feature 'dt' has only 3 unique values - importance may be inflated

## Recommendations

  1. Use implicit_fdm as the default solver
  2. Consider removing ML selector for this IC (T0 = 1 - r^2)
  3. Improve spectral solver stability for threshold-based chi
  4. Add more diverse initial conditions to training data
